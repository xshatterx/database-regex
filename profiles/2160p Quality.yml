name: 2160p Quality
description: "2160p Quality utilizes the [**Encode Efficiency Index**](https://dictionarry.dev/wiki/EEi)\
  \ metric at a 55% target ratio to prioritize **transparent** x265 4k encodes. \n\
  \n- 4 quality tiers prioritize encodes from reputable groups, with fallback to high-quality\
  \ WEB-DLs and balanced tier groups. 2 additional quality tiers are placed below\
  \ for further fallback. \n- Special considerations for both **HDR** and **Lossless\
  \ Audio** formats help to push lower tiered encodes over higher tier ones in cases\
  \ where better sources are used.\n- If no 2160p release can be found, the profile\
  \ will fall back to the 1080p Quality Profile. "
